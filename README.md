# MAD in a BHXRB MAXI J1820+070



## Abstract

All the necessary data and scripts to reproduce You B., et al., (2023)



## Description

- `Multi-wavelengths observation data` folder contains the data points which are plotted in **Fig. 1、2、4, and Fig. S7、S8**.
  

- `Time-delay` folder contains

  **(i)** the script `piccf_mc.c` which uses the data points in **Fig. 2** to determine the lags between flares of different wavelengths; 

  **(ii)** the script `iccf.py` is used to plot the relevant results in **Fig. S1**.
  

- `Formation of a MAD` folder contains one script `code.ipynb`  which is used to plot **Fig. S3-S6**. The source code which simulates the magnetic field is also provided. 
  
- `Simulation of a DIM` folder contains the source code which simulates the DIM.
